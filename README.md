- 👋 Hi, I’m @yellowman1273
- 👀 I’m interested in computer programming (otherwise why would I be on GitHub), computer science, and filmmaking.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more through coding a compiler for my own programming language
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing currently.
- 📫 I'd rather not say how you can reach me.
